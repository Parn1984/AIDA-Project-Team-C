# open points

To do that, the following tasks need to be accomplished:
1. Understand the content that is available in the dataset.
    - **spalten beschreibung?**
    - **was bedeutet was?**
        - **einheiten der werte?**
        - **redundanz in den Daten?**
    - **was ist churn?**
2. Pre-process the data and do feature selection to extract the most important features.
    - **plotting? / pairgrid**
    - **PCA? Feature Reduction...**
        - **PCA lässt sich nicht erklären... raus? oder einmal spielen? Bonus Punkte?**
3. Use a two fold cross-validation approach for evaluating all of the algorithms
mentioned below.
    - **todo...**
4. Feed Forward based classification
    - Build a feed forward neural network to classify the records into one of the two categories.
        - **einfaches Netz bauen... kein großer Aufwand**
    - Compare the performance of different activation functions and loss functions on the proposed task.
        - **model in saubere schleife bauen**
        - **mehrfach laufen lassen...**
    - Analyze the outcomes.
        - **plot history**
        - **weitere analysen?**
5. Classification method of your choice
    - Use a classifier of your choice to classify the records into one of the two categories.
    - Analyze the impact of hyperparameters on the performance of the model on validation and test sets.
    - Analyze the outcomes.
6. Use the different packages of visualization explained during the course to visualize
findings from both approaches.
7. Compare the results from both classifiers from the accuracy point of view.

# Deliverables
To carry out the assessment of the project, the group has to submit the following:

- A report using Google Doc and explaining the concept about the project solution and the expected division of the tasks regarding the components of the group. This document should not be longer than 10 pages (including cover, table of contents, etc).
- Collaborative work using Git with commit + push changes on a daily basis.
- A presentation explaining the thought process, your approaches and the reason for this choice, your findings and the real task division in your group at the end of the project. Every group has 15 minutes per presentation and there will be 5 minutes of questions.
